# FirstPersonController_Godot

Welcome to my place where I saved my first person controller code so I won't have to write it everytime when I start a project.

You're free to use it on your own ones. If you actually want to then -
Note: This doesn't have things like bobbing, animations etc. It's just the code you need to get a character moving.
